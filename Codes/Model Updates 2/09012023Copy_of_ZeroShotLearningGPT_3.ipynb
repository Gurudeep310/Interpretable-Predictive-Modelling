When it came around to me I declined saying that what I had to say was a bit depressing. I was encouraged to talk and choking on tears I simply said that I wanted to see New Years Eve 2017. None of us thought I'd even be here to see this one. Everyone went quiet and looked away. One of the friends put his hand on my shoulder and encouraged me saying he was proud.
